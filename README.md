# 🔐 Phishing URL Detection System

This project is a simple web application that checks whether a given website URL looks **safe**, **suspicious**, or **phishing** based on common phishing patterns.

The application is developed using **Python Flask** and basic rule-based logic. It is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.

## 📖 About the Project

Phishing websites try to trick users into giving sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, or OTPs.  
This project helps in identifying such URLs by analyzing their structure.

The system does **not use real-time internet scanning**.  
Instead, it checks the URL format and applies logical rules to classify it.
